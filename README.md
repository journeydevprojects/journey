# Journey

## About
Journey is an app that allows users to experience a “Story” where the user will walk through several “Story Points” and for each Story Point make a “Decision” which leads to another Story Point. There are many applications of this, but the first known use case is “an empathy-based learning tool that houses Trauma Informed Care cases regarding vulnerable populations.” The implementation of the app, however, should remain flexible enough to handle other use cases.

## Local Development

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) must be installed.

Once node is installed you can install app interdependencies using npm

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, you can run the app locally on http://localhost:3000 by running

```shell
npm run dev
```
